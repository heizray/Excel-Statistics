# Conclusions üí°

### Uganda Income Levels
- *Mean Income*: $62,000
- *Variance*: 30
- *Standard Deviation*: 5.5
  - The standard deviation is relatively low, meaning income levels in Uganda are tightly grouped around the mean ($62,000). There's less variability among individual's incomes.

### France Income Levels
- *Mean Income*: $62,000
- *Variance*: 895.75
- *Standard Deviation*: 29.9
  - The standard deviation is much higher than Uganda's, indicating a wider spread in income levels in France. Some individuals earn significantly more or less than the mean income.

### Insights:
1. *Income Variability*:
   - Uganda's income levels are more consistent and show less disparity.
   - France's income levels exhibit a higher degree of variation, suggesting significant income inequality or diverse earning potential.

2. *Economic Implications*:
   - Uganda may have a more uniform distribution of income, possibly due to limited economic diversity.
   - France's larger standard deviation may reflect a diverse economy with varying income levels across different professions or regions.

3. *Comparison*:
   - While both datasets share the same mean, the higher variance and standard deviation in France suggest a more heterogeneous income distribution compared to Uganda.
